# bevvy's vinyl collection

this site was originally mirrored from [my neocities](https://bevvy.neocities.org/) on January 25 2026 with the intent of allowing myself more space for future experimentation with Github Pages. anything or nothing could happen here.

insofar, the single-page site has been modularized and a now page has been added. i've also decided to mirror the code back to neocities. i still have the original monolithic version, but it's in the git history so it's no big deal.
